I'm Rishit Das, a Cognitive Science major with a keen interest in interdisciplinary computer science projects. I'm passionate about leveraging technology for innovative projects. My work spans AI, VR, and related data analysis projects. My aim in all my work is to blend cognitive science with computer science to create impactful user-facing applications.

### My Recent Experiences

| Project       | Description                                                                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GARDE**     | Developed a fencing AI coach for Team USA Fencing using TensorFlow's BlazePose and React. Fencing is expensive and I believe lowering the barrier of entry is important.            |
| **Wavelength**| Tech lead for a Spotify-based dating app using Flask, D3.js, Spotipy, and AWS, overcoming API limits. Too many users think dating apps suck, and I think that calls for important improvement, with music being a creative solution. |
| **Rhythmoji** | Created a webapp that converts Spotify listening data into a Lego character. More of a first step into projects; something I hope to return to and improve.                        |
