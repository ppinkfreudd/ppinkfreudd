### Hi!
I'm Rishit, a Computational Cognitive Science undergrad with a keen interest in interdisciplinary computer science projects.

### My Recent Experiences

| Project       | Description                                                                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GARDE**     | Developed a fencing AI coach for Team USA Fencing using TensorFlow's BlazePose and React. Fencing is expensive and I believe lowering the barrier of entry is important.            |
| **Wavelength**| Tech lead for a Spotify-based dating app using Flask, D3.js, Spotipy, and AWS, overcoming API limits. Too many users think dating apps suck, and I think that calls for important improvement, with music being a creative solution. |
| **Rhythmoji** | Created a webapp that converts Spotify listening data into a Lego character. More of a first step into projects; something I hope to return to and improve.                        |
